This folder contains screenshots and demo images for the Facial Recognition System documentation.

## Files

### target-photo.png
Example of a target person photo used for facial recognition. This shows the type of clear, front-facing photo that works best with the system.

### detection-result-1.jpg
Detection result showing a match at 4.00 seconds into the video. The green bounding box indicates a successful match with the target person.

### detection-result-2.jpg
Another detection result at 8.00 seconds, demonstrating the system's ability to track the person across multiple frames.

## Usage

These images are used in the main README.md to demonstrate the system's capabilities. They are included in the repository for documentation purposes.

## Adding New Screenshots

To add new screenshots:

1. Place the image file in this directory
2. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `feature-name.png`)
3. Update the main README.md with the new screenshot
4. Commit and push to the repository

## Image Guidelines

- Use PNG format for UI screenshots
- Use JPG format for detection results
- Keep file sizes reasonable (< 2MB per image)
- Use clear, high-quality images
- Annotate images if necessary to highlight features
